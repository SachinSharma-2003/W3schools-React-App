# ‚öõÔ∏è W3Schools Homepage Header Clone (Single-Page React)

A focused project to replicate the iconic header and main landing section of the W3Schools homepage using **React** and modern CSS. This is a single-page, static visual clone intended to demonstrate component-based architecture and CSS replication skills.

## ‚ú® Project Scope

* **Goal:** Visually replicate the structure, dark color scheme, typography, and button styling seen in the provided W3Schools homepage screenshot.
* **Status:** A static, single-page component (no routing or backend functionality).
* **Focus:** **Component Composition** and **Pixel-Perfect CSS** implementation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Used

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React** | Component structure and modular UI development. |
| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Component logic. |
| **CSS (or SCSS/Styled Components)** | Styling the distinct dark background, navigation bar, search bar, and button elements. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App (or similar setup).

### Prerequisites

You must have **Node.js** and **npm** (or yarn) installed.

### Installation and Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    # yarn start
    ```

    The visual clone should be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üì¶ Component Structure

The visual elements in the screenshot are broken down into simple, manageable components for clarity:

* **`App.js`**: Renders the main `HomepageHeader` component.
* **`HomepageHeader.js`**: Contains the full-screen dark section, often including:
    * `TopNavigationBar.js` (The very top menu: Tutorials, Exercises, etc.)
    * `CourseMenu.js` (The second row of links: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)
    * `HeroSection.js` (The central "Learn to Code" text and search bar.)

## üéØ Key Achievements

* Accurate replication of the **W3Schools dark theme** color palette.
* Implementation of **CSS Flexbox** for the complex, horizontal navigation bars.
* Creating the **distinct two-part search/button input field** layout.
